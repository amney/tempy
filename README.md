tempy
=====

tempy is a small little app to monitor the temperature of a homebrew using a Raspberry Pi.

A simple web interface is provided via Flask and time-series graphs are rendered using Rickshaw.js

LED status lights wired on a breadboard on the Pi are set using GPIO to give quick visual feedback
of the current temperature
